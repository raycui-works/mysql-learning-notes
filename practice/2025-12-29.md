输出每个演员的电影数，并把演员分成三档：
	•	0 部
	•	1 部
	•	2+ 部
最后统计每档各有多少演员（输出 3 行：档位 + 人数）

初步：
film_bucket   actor_count  
0            x
1            x
2+           x

```sql
SELECT '0' AS film_bucket, COUNT(*) AS actor_count
FROM (
      SELECT a.actor_id, COUNT(fa.film_id) AS film_count
      FROM actor a
      LEFT JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
      GROUP BY a.actor_id
) t
WHERE film_count = 0

UNION ALL

SELECT '1' AS film_bucket, COUNT(*) AS actor_count
FROM (
      SELECT a.actor_id, COUNT(fa.film_id) AS film_count
      FROM actor a
      LEFT JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
      GROUP BY a.actor_id
) t
WHERE film_count = 1

UNION ALL

SELECT '2+' AS film_bucket, COUNT(*) AS actor_count
FROM (
      SELECT a.actor_id, COUNT(fa.film_id) AS film_count
      FROM actor a
      LEFT JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
      GROUP BY a.actor_id
) t
WHERE film_count >= 2;
```

另一种写法：
```sql
SELECT
	CASE
	  WHEN film_count = 0 THEN '0'
	  WHEN film_count = 1 THEN '1'
	  ELSE '2+'
	END AS film_bucket,
	COUNT(*) AS actor_count
FROM (
	SELECT a.actor_id, COUNT(fa.film_id) AS film_count
	FROM actor a
	LEFT JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
	GROUP BY a.actor_id
) t
GROUP BY film_bucket
ORDER BY
	CASE film_bucket WHEN '0' THEN 0 WHEN '1' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END;
```
>如果觉得CASE太长，可以这样写：
>写法1：直接按自定义顺序（MySQL 常用）
```sql
ORDER BY FIELD(film_bucket, '0', '1', '2+');
```
>写法2：先在 SELECT 里算一个 sort_key（更好读）
```sql
SELECT film_bucket, COUNT(*) AS actor_count,
       CASE film_bucket WHEN '0' THEN 0 WHEN '1' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END AS sort_key
FROM ...
GROUP BY film_bucket
ORDER BY sort_key;
```
